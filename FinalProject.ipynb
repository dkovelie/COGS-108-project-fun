    "The purpose of this project is to determine how do different regional factors influence unemployment rate in addition to attempting to come up with an equation that could predict unemployment rate using strongly correlated facotrs. All correlations used for the formation of the unemployment rate prediction equation will be derived from a dataset containing various information from several different Wal-Mart stores within the U.S. Wal-Mart data specfically will be used for the purposes of this project because Wal-Mart, as the \"largest private sector employer in the US,\" is often a \"lightning rod for criticism\" concerning issues of worker compensation, pay, and employment (1). In addition to being the largest private employer, research has also shown that Wal-Mart is so huge in the United States that there can even be implications for regional unemployment rates when a Wal-Mart moves into an area (2). Therefore, any correlations that can be found might be applicable and useful to other popular corporations wanting to open up another store in a specific area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based upson some findings on the relationship of unemployment rate to inflation(3) and to changes in gas prices(4), We resonably hypothesized that factors such as comsumer price index (CPI), fuel price, and weekly sales will correlate strongly with unemployment rate with a negative, postive, and negative correlation respectively. Therefore, these will be the factors that will be included in the overall unemployment rate prediction equation. In addition, we hypothesized that other factors, such as average regional temerpature and holidays, would have a weak correlation with unemployment rate over time and will be dropped from the overall prediction equation due to negligble effects on unemployment.\n",

    "There are a few jobs to do to make the data usable for the types of analysis we desire. Since the datasets were made with a particular cause in mind, not all the data is relevant, as well as some of the observations are missing certain key data or are in a datatype not conducive to our analysis. \n",
    "To clean the data, we first remove columns not relevant to our analysis. The columns named Markdown 1-5 in features.csv will not be used in the analysis. To aid the analysis, we want all the relevant data in one dataset, and we want to use the weekly sales information from train.csv. The issue with train.csv is that not only are the observations split across store and date as with features.csv, but also across department. In order to add them to features, we first sum the weekly sales for each department on the same date in the same store, then we add that total weekly sales to the features dataset on store and date. Once that is accomplished, we change the data in the \"Date\" column to be an integer instead of a string for plotting and analysis convenience. Lastly, we remove rows with missing unemployment data and check for outliers."

    "As mentioned before, the data about Walmart was founded on Kaggle, a public space where datasets can be accessible to those with the link to that information. Since most of these are being used for competition purposes, the purpose of providing the data was to have anyone analyze it, meaning that the public was free to download the data with no restrictions nor hold additional responsibilities of it. The owner of the data, however, was not provided in Kaggle and makes its credibility questionable. Not knowing who provided the data and how they retrieved such information raises questions such as “how much of the data given was extracted from the original source?” and “how accurate is this information?”\n",

The data being anonymized was good in the sense that no one’s information such as their name, race, age, etc. affected was presented thereby ensuring no clear biases within the sets. Since no additional datasets were added to the research, the missing information about some factors for each Walmart such as their location had to be assumed by other data information."

    "In the analysis, we found that all four of the main factors analyzed were significant in predicting unemployment. In line with our hypothesis, CPI, weekly sales, and fuel price did have negative correlations with unemployment rate. Where we were surprised, however, was to find that temperature did have a significant correlation with unemployment in our model, and a positive one, at that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given background research on how CPI and fuel price impact unemployment rate, the results we found are aligned with these findings. Weekly sales intuitively makes sense as with an increase in weekly sales, there would be a higher need for workers as those are busier times for the store, leading to a negative relationship with unemployment. Temperature may have to do with seasonal changes in demand. In the data visualization section, while temperature and unemployment do not appear to have a strong correlation initially, there is a cluster of higher unemployment rates when the temperature is high, which may indicate that unemployment is lower during the colder seasons. This may be due to how certain major holidays that are important for retail stores like Christmas or Thanksgiving are during the colder times of the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the coefficients found in the model, we can see how much a change in a factor can influence unemployment. For example, a $10 million increase in weekly sales would lead to about a 4 percent decrease in unemployment. Alternatively, to get a 1 percent decrease in unemployment, you would need an increase in more than $2.503 million. Math shown below.  "
